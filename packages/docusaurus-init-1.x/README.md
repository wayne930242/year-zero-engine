## `docusaurus-init`

An initialization script for [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).

### What does it do?

Docusaurus was designed from the ground up to be easily installed and used to get your website up an running quickly. To install Docusaurus, we have created an easy script that will get all of the infrastructure setup for you:

1. Have Node >= 8.x installed. Yarn >= 1.5 is recommended as well.
1. Go into the root of your GitHub repo directory where you will be creating the docs.
1. `npx docusaurus-init`

> If you don't have Node 8.2+ or if you prefer to install Docusaurus globally, run yarn global add docusaurus-init or npm install --global docusaurus-init. After that, run docusaurus-init.
